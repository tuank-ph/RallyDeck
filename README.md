# RallyDeck
**Who are we?**

We're Curiosity, just a bunch of Vietnamese high school students who have a knack for solving problems, building cool stuff, and staying up way too late chatting about the ideas that get us fired up. Some of us are into coding, while others are all about design or figuring out how to make things work better—and together, we make a pretty awesome team. This hackathon is our opportunity to turn our ideas into reality, learn from one another, and show ourselves that we can achieve more than we ever thought possible. We might be young, but we’re bursting with energy, curiosity, and the determination to create something meaningful. With every project, we strive to blend fun with practicality. We want to transform boring concepts into exciting ideas and bring our ambitions to life for the greater good. For us, informatics isn’t just a hobby; it’s our passion.

**RallyDeck and the inspiration behind it**

Entertainment is a vital part of life, whether you’re a student or in any other profession—who wouldn’t want to kick back after a long day? For us, our favorite way to unwind is by diving into our beloved sports. We’re total fanatics, staying up late for big games and following all the pundits. But what we loved most was collecting. Whether it was player jerseys, autographed photos, or anything else, we found that nothing quite satisfied that “itch” we had. We craved a sense of ownership and investment. At the same time, we were getting fed up with sifting through endless news sites just to catch match results or athlete drama. That’s where RallyDeck comes in—a trading platform for NFTs and a source for sports news. Think of it as collecting those old sports cards that used to come in cereal boxes, but on a much grander scale. Every card or collection you buy is an asset, an exclusive collectible for any die-hard sports fan.
